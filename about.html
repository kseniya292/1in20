				<p>Living with mental illness is many things, it can be ugly, painful, exhausting and life threatening, and it can also be tender, beautiful and transformative. 1in20 is a place where you can connect, both heart and mind, with those who have walked before you, and others who walk alongside you.</p>
				<p>“More than an awareness campaign, more than healing through art, more than stigma-fighters, 1in20 is a living breathing community offering validation, support and a creative outlet for people coping with and surviving mental illness.”</p>
				</p>Our mission is to close the gap between the vital but impersonal research conducted by academics and clinicians and how it really feels when you are suffering from depression or mental illness. We aim to provide a platform where you can share your stories, discover that you are not alone, and find a safe outlet to express everything you are experiencing, from despair, to joy, to fear, to hope, and in time, to recovery.</p>
				<p>If you are a sufferer, friend, family member, or caregiver suffering in silence, we invite you to join us and share your story *.</p>
				<p>* We understand it can be difficult to share your story with the world so we would like you to know that you can remain anonymous to our readers.</p>
